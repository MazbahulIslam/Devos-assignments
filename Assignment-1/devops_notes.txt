                                                   DevOps
                                               ..............
 
DevOps is a procedure where software developers and operations teams both work toward the same aim.
Both teams' targets are software that is quick to make, frequently updated, and any bug fee delivery to users. 
DevOps is just not a tool-set, where automation, cooperation and continuous improvement are very important.

                                                CLMS Framework
                                             ...................   
CLMS has 5 main words. 
These are:
 
C -> Culture (Between the team there are mutual helps, trust, and a together-works mentality)
L -> Lean (unless it is an important step and unless cost-smart and fast delivery are confirmed)
A -> Automation (when we see Repetitive and risky work, then this work is completed by automation tools)
M -> Measurement (Daily monitor system, apps and team performances)
S -> Sharing (It is most importance to share knowledge, experience and responsibility among team. Problem fastly solve when communication level is strong)
